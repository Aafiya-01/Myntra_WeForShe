###Problem Statement
In 2024, Myntra's monthly active users touched the 60 million mark, with 6 million customers making 30 visits to the platform each month on average, according to the fashion and beauty e-retailerâ€™s trend report.

Despite attracting nearly 75 million new users in the past year, with 65% from non-metro cities, the online fashion industry still struggles to replicate the social and interactive aspects that are crucial for engaging younger audiences. The fashion industry thrives on constant change and self-expression, especially among younger audiences. However, online shopping often lacks the social and interactive elements that drive habitual usage, and position Myntra as the go-to destination for fashion enthusiasts.
